# TemporaryFolder
This VB Script can automatically remove all of the contents of a specified directory after a certain number of days. USE WITH CAUTION: No error checking to prevent deleting system files, and no recovery of deleted files.

## Outdated
This VB Script is a bit outdated. I recommend you try my [DeleteTemporaryFiles Windows Application](https://github.com/lockworld/DeleteTemporaryFiles) application instead.
